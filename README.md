A VHDL project proposing an implementation of a hardware oriented reservoir computer on FPGAâ€™s to create a crypto-chaotic communication channel
# Abstract
This research paper proposes a hardware-oriented Reservoir Computer topology
called Cyclic Reservoir that is able to achieve close to state-of-the-art performance 
for chaotic time series prediction. A hardware implementation targeting FPGAs 
using Stochastic Computing elements is then proposed that is able to substantially 
reduce the hardware resource demand of the network and avails of a high 
robustness to environmental noise. A chaotic communication channel using the 
hardware implementation of the Reservoir Computer is proposed that is more 
secure than analog chaotic circuit communication channels and plausibly more 
efficient in real-world use than other Artificial Neural Network based chaotic 
communication channels.
